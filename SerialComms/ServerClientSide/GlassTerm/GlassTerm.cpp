// Purpose: Glass Term : read/Write from keyboard/serial port : example code for SDK

// This uses the first serial port on the system, and offers a choice between different
// handshaking modes.  All control characters apart from carriage returns and line feeds are
// displayed on the screen with ^ carets in from of the the ASCII equivalent (so tab = ^I)

// The ESC key is used to end the program

// Note :

// In order for this program to do anything, the serial port should be connected to something.
// A modem is of course quite suitable.  In the absence of a modem, a loopback plug with the
// receive and transmit lines connected will echo all serial port output to the screen.  In
// the absence of a loopback plug, a bent paper clip or somethings similar connecting pins 2 and 3
// on any 25 or 9 way serial connector will do exactly the same thing.  This last suggestion
// is something that is carried out entirely at your own risk, and you should be very careful
// neither to connect any other pins by mistake nor to push the paper clip in too far !

// If using the bent paper clip, you'll find that in order for the hardware handshaking option
// to work, a second bent paper clip connecting pins 4 and 5 on a 25-way connector or pin 7 and 8
// on a 9-way connector will also be needed - this second paper clip is needed to connect RTS to CTS

// Note: this sample program now shows how to support infra-red as well
// as RS232 and also systems with multiple serial ports and multiple
// possible CSYs.
